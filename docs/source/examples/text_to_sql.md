# Text-to-SQL

In this tutorial, we’ll see how to implement an agent that leverages SQL using `smolagents`.

> Let's start with the goldnen question: why not keep it simple and use a standard text-to-SQL pipeline?

A standard text-to-sql pipeline is brittle, since the generated SQL query can be incorrect. Even worse, the query could be incorrect, but not raise an error, instead giving some incorrect/useless outputs without raising an alarm.

👉 Instead, an agent system is able to critically inspect outputs and decide if the query needs to be changed or not, thus giving it a huge performance boost.

Let’s build this agent! 💪

### Setup text to SQL
```py
from sqlalchemy import (
    create_engine,
    MetaData,
    Table,
    Column,
    String,
    Integer,
    Float,
    insert,
    inspect,
    text,
)

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///:memory:")
metadata_obj = MetaData()

# create city SQL table
table_name = "receipts"
receipts = Table(
    table_name,
    metadata_obj,
    Column("receipt_id", Integer, primary_key=True),
    Column("customer_name", String(16), primary_key=True),
    Column("price", Float),
    Column("tip", Float),
)
metadata_obj.create_all(engine)
```

```py
rows = [
    {"receipt_id": 1, "customer_name": "Alan Payne", "price": 12.06, "tip": 1.20},
    {"receipt_id": 2, "customer_name": "Alex Mason", "price": 23.86, "tip": 0.24},
    {"receipt_id": 3, "customer_name": "Woodrow Wilson", "price": 53.43, "tip": 5.43},
    {"receipt_id": 4, "customer_name": "Margaret James", "price": 21.11, "tip": 1.00},
]
for row in rows:
    stmt = insert(receipts).values(**row)
    with engine.begin() as connection:
        cursor = connection.execute(stmt)
```

### Build our agent

Now let’s make our SQL table retrievable by a tool.

The tool’s description attribute will be embedded in the LLM’s prompt by the agent system: it gives the LLM information about how to use the tool. So that is where we want to describe the SQL table.

```py
inspector = inspect(engine)
columns_info = [(col["name"], col["type"]) for col in inspector.get_columns("receipts")]

table_description = "Columns:\n" + "\n".join([f"  - {name}: {col_type}" for name, col_type in columns_info])
print(table_description)
```

```text
Columns:
  - receipt_id: INTEGER
  - customer_name: VARCHAR(16)
  - price: FLOAT
  - tip: FLOAT
```

Now let’s build our tool. It needs the following: (read [the tool doc](../tutorials/tools) for more detail)
- A docstring with an `Args:` part listing arguments.
- Type hints on both inputs and output.

```py
from transformers.agents import tool

@tool
def sql_engine(query: str) -> str:
    """
    Allows you to perform SQL queries on the table. Returns a string representation of the result.
    The table is named 'receipts'. Its description is as follows:
        Columns:
        - receipt_id: INTEGER
        - customer_name: VARCHAR(16)
        - price: FLOAT
        - tip: FLOAT

    Args:
        query: The query to perform. This should be correct SQL.
    """
    output = ""
    with engine.connect() as con:
        rows = con.execute(text(query))
        for row in rows:
            output += "\n" + str(row)
    return output
```

Now let us create an agent that leverages this tool.

We use the CodeAgent, which is transformers.agents’ main agent class: an agent that writes actions in code and can iterate on previous output according to the ReAct framework.

The llm_engine is the LLM that powers the agent system. HfEngine allows you to call LLMs using HF’s Inference API, either via Serverless or Dedicated endpoint, but you could also use any proprietary API.

```py
from transformers.agents import CodeAgent, HfApiEngine

agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[sql_engine],
    llm_engine=HfApiEngine("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct"),
)
agent.run("Can you give me the name of the client who got the most expensive receipt?")
```

### Level 2: Table joins

Now let’s make it more challenging! We want our agent to handle joins across multiple tables.

So let’s make a second table recording the names of waiters for each receipt_id!

```py
table_name = "waiters"
receipts = Table(
    table_name,
    metadata_obj,
    Column("receipt_id", Integer, primary_key=True),
    Column("waiter_name", String(16), primary_key=True),
)
metadata_obj.create_all(engine)

rows = [
    {"receipt_id": 1, "waiter_name": "Corey Johnson"},
    {"receipt_id": 2, "waiter_name": "Michael Watts"},
    {"receipt_id": 3, "waiter_name": "Michael Watts"},
    {"receipt_id": 4, "waiter_name": "Margaret James"},
]
for row in rows:
    stmt = insert(receipts).values(**row)
    with engine.begin() as connection:
        cursor = connection.execute(stmt)
```
Since we changed the table, we update the `SQLExecutorTool` with this table’s description to let the LLM properly leverage information from this table.

```py
updated_description = """Allows you to perform SQL queries on the table. Beware that this tool's output is a string representation of the execution output.
It can use the following tables:"""

inspector = inspect(engine)
for table in ["receipts", "waiters"]:
    columns_info = [(col["name"], col["type"]) for col in inspector.get_columns(table)]

    table_description = f"Table '{table}':\n"

    table_description += "Columns:\n" + "\n".join([f"  - {name}: {col_type}" for name, col_type in columns_info])
    updated_description += "\n\n" + table_description

print(updated_description)
```
Since this request is a bit harder than the previous one, we’ll switch the LLM engine to use the more powerful [Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct)!

```py
sql_engine.description = updated_description

agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[sql_engine],
    llm_engine=HfApiEngine("Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct"),
)

agent.run("Which waiter got more total money from tips?")
```
It directly works! The setup was surprisingly simple, wasn’t it?

This example is done! We've touched upon these concepts:
- Building new tools.
- Updating a tool's description.
- Switching to a stronger LLM helps agent reasoning.

✅ Now you can go build this text-to-SQL system you’ve always dreamt of! ✨
